## Code

 - HTML5, CSS3, ES5
 - [jQuery v3.2.1](http://jquery.org "jQuery v3.2.1")
 - [Materialize v0.97.8](http://materializecss.com "Materialize")
 - [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/ "Google Material Icons")

The main goal was to make as low size as posibble to speed up loading. Result is around ~700kB and time +/- 1s... amazing
